because i am very confused on how to use github and insert images in the file i will just upload all the images into the documentation folder and explain all of them here.
sketchbook photo:
  i drew out a sketch of my inital concept first. i wanted to create a whimsical abstract self portrait. i added fun shapes around my head and eyes to portray my tendency to daydream and how i can get lost in my thoughts. i chose to give my portrait fun earrings for aesthetic purposes as well as my personal love for jewelry
screenshot 1: first i drew the basic proportions of my portrait
screenshot 2: i used triangles to make the features, added fill for colours, and removed the outline to create a simpler aesthetic
screenshot 3: i experimented with types of earrings inspired by my real life earrings
screenshot 4: i finalized on the earrings and chose the colour
screenshot 5: i added the shapes of all my 'thoughts'
screenshot 6: i added the colours to my 'thoughts' and added aditional piercings and details

final project: i added finishing touches like adjusting shapes and adding a background
