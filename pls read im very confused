hello professor mathura,
i am very confused on how to use github. i am trying to delete things but it wont work. i am trying to organize things but it wont work. 
the blogposts that you have linked were slighlty helpful but many of them were from before a ui update i think because they didnt make any sense to me :(
i dont understand the branches or tags or anything so i cant delete the week1 folder which is a mess and doesnt make sense
for now, i am putting my project in the projects folder and hoping it is readable and i did it right

thanks, insiya
