### [current project?](https://editor.p5js.org/insiyam/sketches/e4JG3tFBa)
### progress
##### stage 1 : ideas
i've had multiple ideas for my game but ive had to let go of many of them (including the ones i said in class) because i don't think i have the necessary skills to achieve my goal. i originally really wanted to a jigsaw puzzle since thats my personal favourite game but i have been unable to find a way to create the circle divets in each shape. the only way i could think of was to precut the image in some other software insert each individual piece as an image. i didn't realli like this plan so i decided to do a more rpg/casual style game that would center around creating jam. even though this is a very simplistic idea i feel like it is authetnic to me and follows the coincedtanl nature theme all my projects so far have taken.
##### stage 2 : research
i started doing research on types of games, ranging from games i personally play to online p5js games to have a more concrete idea of my game. these pages from my sketchbook walk through my process (i tried to scan them in but i dont know to use the exact software of the scanners here so i just took pictures but i will scan them in later)

i also want to mention the [game](https://groverburger.itch.io/florpfarming) i came across online that gave me the inspiration for the types of mechanics i can use. the entirety of my gameplay will be conducted by dragging objects around and buttons. 
##### stage 3 : story and art board
for my game, ive created a very simple story with some customization up to the player. i don't really want to give away the plot in case you read this before playing the final game so i will include the storyboard in the final documentation. the specific options that the player can select don't necasarily affect the end game result they just impact the narrative experience of the story and allow you to become closer to the npc if the player chooses to do so. ive also decided on a specific art style i will be creating this game which requires me to upload all of the objects as images so i wont be creating any shapes directly in p5js. for the background drawings im creating them with watercolours before digitizing them and uploading them in p5js. to experiment with the code itself i created rough sketches of the background on adobe but unfortunaetly my aodbe account was having so many issues and none of sketches were saved so my current background is even more rough. although im not done with creating all the art for my project and i think this will be the very time consuming, i do also know that this will be my faourite part of a creating a game.
##### stage 4 : coding 
this, as expected, has been the roughest part of my project. ive been struggling already as my p5js editor doesn't let me upload any files of any sort which is a big problem considering my entire game will be imported through files. however i decided to just try and move on and work on some of the base mechanics of the project which is to create different 'locations' that can be accessed through buttons as well as the dragging function for my mouse. since i only have 2 locations and the menu page i decided to create a seperate function (and script sheet) for each of these 'pages'. i also used the ```mouseDragged()``` function and if statements to create the mechanics for the game. the issue for me has been that i havent been able to test out these codes properly because of my uploading problem. additionally, many of the tutorials online just seem to confuse me even more since game development seems to be a bit less beginner than i feel like i a. i dont know if my game is tryig to be too ambitious or if i just dont have the skills necessary to create it.
### reflection
i feel like this project has been very frustrating for me so far. even though originally i was very excited, my struggles with the p5js editor along with the issue with adobe illustrator have left me very behind in my project and even further demotivated me. i really want to catch up but i just feel stuck with the coding and i feel like i cant do it. for now im going to keep focusing on the artwork because thats the only thing i know i can do :( i also think i should come to office hours for help with the actual game creation but i just feel like im so lost that i don't even know how to explain what isn't working and any possible fixes. i really want this game to be amazing and fulfill my initial vision but i feel like im really struggling with everything. im hoping that it will somehow all miraculously work out for me before the deadline but im scared my final submission will be very poorly done and probably just crash or something and its really wprrying me because even though i struggle with every project in this class i always felt like i could learn enough to catch up to my ideas but this game just feel so out of reach for me.
