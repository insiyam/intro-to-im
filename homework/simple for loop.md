originally i was trying to create an ellipse that changed colours but it didn't end up working because the for loop would run too fast so only the last colour would show. after realizing that this was not a good use of for loop.

my new design was inspired by a landscape painting. i wanted to a create a very simple oceanscape but with animations to capture the light and movement in the ocean. i used a for loop to create an ocean of rectangles that would shift colour between a set range of values in the random function. i only changed the g value in rgb to allow for a more clear colour scheme. after adding in a night sky background it looked like this

i then decided to add some details to the sky to make it more clear. i added some stars. this took some trial and error to find the right values for the random function to get the sparse look i wanted. i also decided to add a moon/crescent to fill up the sky. i didn't know how to actually create a crescent shape so i overlayed two elipses with one being the colour as the background so it would blend in. my final work can be viewed [here.](https://editor.p5js.org/insiyam/sketches/apTB8qs7D)
