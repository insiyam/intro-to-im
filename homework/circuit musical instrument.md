### process
##### stage 1 : idea
originally, i really wanted to create a harmonica because i've been meaning to learn it in real life. this dream was sadly not really possible because none of the sensors would really be able to replicate the harmonica. after devyn and i started working on the project, i had an idea to use a water bottle that you have to shake, similar to a tamborine. we tried to create this idea bi inserting two wires on the top section of the bottle so when the bottle was up right the current would be broken. but this didn't really work out as the current was really unstable and also the bottle would start leaking from the holes of the wire. our final idea was a bit simpler, which is to create a piano but since we didnt just want to use force sensors or buttons for every key, we decided to use the ultrasonic sensor.

##### stage 2 : basic mechanics
the beginning was a bit tricky as we were a bit confused about how to start with the ultrasonic sensor so we consulted the internet and figured out how to connect the sensor to the code. once we finalized the distances for our sensor we wrote if statements for each key using the ```tone()``` function. we also used an array to store all our tones and make it simpler when writing the if statements. after this working properly, we added a switch to try and fulffil the digital sensor requirement. i tried to add the switch the same way i did for the last assignment using the switchstate strategy but for some reason it was not 'turning off'. after asking for help, we added the switch in a series circuit so it was a manual switch compared to the one i coded last time.

##### stage 3 : finishing steps
in this last stage we just cleaned up our code and decorated our instrument. we also realized that it was not a piano since you cant use multiple fingers so we decided to make xylophone and we made the little mallet out of tape to go along with.

### final code

### reflection
although, working on this project was very hard for me because of scheduling conflicts, i am pretty happy with our result as its very cute and im proud of us for figuring out the ultrasonic sensor. i find it a bit hard to document the circuit projects as its not as easy as taking screenshots but for the next projects and all i want to try and take more pictures along the way.
