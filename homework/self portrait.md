 i drew out a sketch of my inital concept first. i wanted to create a whimsical abstract self portrait. i added fun shapes around my head and eyes to portray my tendency to daydream and how i can get lost in my thoughts. i chose to give my portrait fun earrings for aesthetic purposes as well as my personal love for jewelry
[screenshot 1:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234625.png) first i drew the basic proportions of my portrait

[screenshot 2:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234707.png) i used triangles to make the features, added fill for colours, and removed the outline to create a simpler aesthetic

[screenshot 3:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234717.png) i experimented with types of earrings inspired by my real life earrings

[screenshot 4:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234732.png) i finalized on the earrings and chose the colour

[screenshot 5:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234739.png)i added the shapes of all my 'thoughts'

[screenshot 6:](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/self%20portrait/Screenshot%202022-01-30%20234745.png) i added the colours to my 'thoughts' and added aditional piercings and details
