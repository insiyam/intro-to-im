### process:
  since i couldn't be as creative with generative text since my fonts weren't working, i decided to create a data visualization work based off of our in class table example. i had selected the data for cherry blossom searched on google trends and i wanted to visualize this data in a more unique way than my [original in-class work](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-20%20231523.png). i wanted to create a scene isnpired by cherry blossom parks like [this](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/cherry-blossom-picture-id164484408?s=170667a) with the size of the blossoms indicating how much they were searched in that time. 

##### stage 1 : basic mechanics
this was an effort that was very tough in the beginning but lightened as i kept going. after browsing on the internet for ways to create my idea, i ended up following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hokTcLVtZs8) which was confusing at first because his system looks a lot different compared to mine but after rewatching it a couple of times i was able to get a hang of it and ended up with an [initial sketch](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234456.png) of scattered of ellipses that were proportional to the number of searches. however, i ran into an issue which was that the google trends data was organized by weeks and not months so it would be hard to create labels and actually visualize the data. this process of manipulating the data was very much based on trial and error and i made multiple copies of the initial csv file to achieve my desired result. i started by adding an extra column titled "Month" and converting all the dates into their corresponding months and adding ```text(month, x, y);``` to make a label. however this created a messy [result](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234537.png) so i actually got new data from google trends again for only one year and tried messing around with the r vale to only show the one circle for every month but  it wasnt my desired [effect](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234544.png). i ended up creating a completely [new excel sheet](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234711.png) where i added all the months and the totals of each month based on the 2021 dataand i used this to create a new [sketch](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234550.png) before tweaking some of the details and creating my final [base mechanics](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234558.png) for this project.

##### stage 2 : (failed) integration of class/objects
this part of my vision was to create a class of flowers made from other shapes and replace the initial ellipse with to visually represent the cherry blossoms better. spolier alert: it was a complete failure. but i'm still going to talk about it here because i would like to get some feedback on if it is possible and where i went wrong. anyways, so i started a new [sketch](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234602.png) where i tried to a flower-esque shape with all the arguments being based around variables so it could proportionally grow or shring like the ellipses. although i was relatively happy with my object i realized a problem occured when the x and y values were too high or low. i thought subtracting like ```this.y-this.y/30``` would be enough but i was very mistaken. i tried to make a ['testing ground'](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234625.png) by placing a flower in each 'quadrant' and adjusting the measurements whihc was a very tedious process but provided soe good [results](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234629.png). im sure there is a more mathematically smarter and simpler way to solve this problem but i just carried on and tried to integrate it into my base mechanics. this was a coplete failure as i couldnt figure out how to initialze the object in my for loop without ```function draw()``` which i couldnt use because the for loop itself was in ```function setup()```
