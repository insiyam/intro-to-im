### process:
  since i couldn't be as creative with generative text since my fonts weren't working, i decided to create a data visualization work based off of our in class table example. i had selected the data for cherry blossom searched on google trends and i wanted to visualize this data in a more unique way than my [original in-class work](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-20%20231523.png). i wanted to create a scene isnpired by cherry blossom parks like [this](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/cherry-blossom-picture-id164484408?s=170667a) with the size of the blossoms indicating how much they were searched in that time. 

##### stage 1 : basic mechanics
this was an effort that was very tough in the beginning but lightened as i kept going. after browsing on the internet for ways to create my idea, i ended up following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hokTcLVtZs8) which was confusing at first because his system looks a lot different compared to mine but after rewatching it a couple of times i was able to get a hang of it and ended up with an [initial sketch](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234456.png) of scattered of ellipses that were proportional to the number of searches. however, i ran into an issue which was that the google trends data was organized by weeks and not months so it would be hard to create labels and actually visualize the data. this process of manipulating the data was very much based on trial and error and i made multiple copies of the initial csv file to achieve my desired result. i started by adding an extra column titled "Month" and converting all the dates into their corresponding months and adding ```text(month, x, y);``` to make a label. however this created a messy [result](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234537.png) so i actually got new datat from google trends again for only one year and tried messing around with the r vale to only show the one circle for every month but  it wasnt my desired [effect](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234544.png)
