### process:
  since i couldn't be as creative with generative text since my fonts weren't working, i decided to create a data visualization work based off of our in class table example. i had selected the data for cherry blossom searched on google trends and i wanted to visualize this data in a more unique way than my [original in-class work](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-20%20231523.png). i wanted to create a scene isnpired by cherry blossom parks like [this](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/cherry-blossom-picture-id164484408?s=170667a) with the size of the blossoms indicating how much they were searched in that time. 

##### stage 1 : basic mechanics
this was an effort that was very tough in the beginning but lightened as i kept going. after browsing on the internet for ways to create my idea, i ended up following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hokTcLVtZs8) which was confusing at first because his system looks a lot different compared to mine but after rewatching it a couple of times i was able to get a hang of it and ended up with an [initial sketch](https://github.com/insiyam/intro-to-im/blob/first/media/data%20visualization/Screenshot%202022-02-21%20234456.png) of scattered of ellipses that were proportional to the number of searches.
