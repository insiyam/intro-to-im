### process

##### stage 1 : idea
for this project i was inspired by memories from my childhood. when i was young and learning how to use forks and western cutlery, my mom would always try and instill good manners and she would tell me to never bang my spoon and make sure it doesn't make a clanging noise. im not sure if this is an actual 'good manners' skill but i was inspired by this and wanted to create a switch that worked with the cutlery.

##### stage 2 : creating the circuit
after having the idea, i started to create my circuit. i recreated the mechanism we made in class to light an led bulb but i added an extra ground wire so i had a break in the circuit where you would need to reconnect the two wires. the circuit itself was very simple and took me little effort but for some reason i struggled to find the cutlery. i have a set of cutlery that i brought from home but for some reason the butter knife was not conductive. lukccily the spoon and fork i had recieved during quarantine were conductive so i used those instead. i assume its something to do with the type of metal but i couldnt figure it out exactly. 

##### stage 3 : filming
i tried to create a video in s short film type aesthetic. i shot different clips of my circuit and then i edited them together.

### reflection
although i feel this was a simple but cute idea, im excited to learn more about circuits and try to create something more challenging. i feel like i dont have the best grasp of the physics behind our work but im just going to take it one step at a time and hopefully i will be okay.
